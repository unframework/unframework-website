I am a product technical lead at [Myplanet](http://myplanet.com).

My primary research interest is in modelling real-life communication and business workflows and using that to improve human process and automation. In addition, I spend time analyzing software development techniques themselves - founded on a belief that [programming is theory-building](http://www.dc.uba.ar/materias/plp/cursos/material/programmingAsTheoryBuilding).

See my [open source projects on GitHub](https://github.com/unframework), [Twitter profile](https://twitter.com/unframework) and [Medium posts](https://medium.com/@unframework). Plus occasional [presentation upload on my SpeakerDeck page](https://speakerdeck.com/unframework).

UI architecture work:

* [UI Rendering: Change Detection Without Observables](/ui-repaint)
    * [vdom-live: minimalist virtual DOM renderer with no observables](https://github.com/unframework/vdom-live)
* [MVC and Modeling User Attention Span](/view-attention-span)
* [HTML/CSS Encapsulation At Runtime](/html-css-encapsulation-at-runtime)
    * [Airtight CSS Lint: enforcing encapsulation using BEM-like syntax](https://github.com/unframework/airtight-css-lint)
* [Angular UX Tips](http://ng-ux.tips)

Database persistence and ORM work:

* [Fxrm Store: DDD-inspired alternate ORM library](https://github.com/fxrm/fxrm-store)
* [Enterprise Apps: ORM vs Key-Value Storage Model](/orm-vs-key-value)
* [Somewhat discouraging responses on Reddit :)](https://www.reddit.com/r/programming/comments/2t36ra/disappointed_in_orm_keyvalue_store_might_be_a/)
