I am a product technical lead at [Myplanet](http://myplanet.com).

My primary research interest is in modelling real-life communication and business workflows and using that to improve human process and automation. In addition, I spend time analyzing software development techniques themselves - founded on a belief that [programming is theory-building](http://www.dc.uba.ar/materias/plp/cursos/material/programmingAsTheoryBuilding).

See my [open source projects on GitHub](https://github.com/unframework), [Twitter profile](https://twitter.com/unframework) and [Medium posts](https://medium.com/@unframework). Plus occasional [presentation upload on my SpeakerDeck page](https://speakerdeck.com/unframework).
