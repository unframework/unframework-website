I am a product technical lead at [Myplanet](http://myplanet.com).

My primary research interest is in modelling real-life communication and business workflows and using that to improve human process and automation. That means both back-end topics like data versioning and consistency and front-end matters like HCI/UX. In addition, I spend time analyzing software development techniques themselves - founded on a belief that [programming is theory-building](http://www.dc.uba.ar/materias/plp/cursos/material/programmingAsTheoryBuilding).

See my [open source projects on GitHub](https://github.com/unframework), [Twitter profile](https://twitter.com/unframework) and [Medium posts](https://medium.com/@unframework). Plus occasional [presentation upload on my SpeakerDeck page](https://speakerdeck.com/unframework). I also dabble in pictures: [see my Flickr profile](https://www.flickr.com/photos/nickmatantsev/).

Favourite moments that shaped who I am as a techie:

* coding Bresenham lines for CGA and VGA display using INT10 in Turbo C as a pre-teen
* getting Quake3 level spline patches to load and render using OpenGL in my Verlet-based physics racer experiment (I used them to make a half-pipe)
* fixing a cgi-bin script written in Bash, in 1999
* live-editing MBR and swapping a Linux root partition to use software RAID-1 on a small office server
* getting over impostor syndrome by reading other people's Perl CPAN code
* taking a proper accounting class and secretly loving it (most useful university course ever)
* becoming comfortable with Prolog
* hacking together a simple constructive solid geometry (CSG) triangulation proof of concept (Java, BSP trees)
* eating humble pie by seeing live user tests break my UX assumptions on early freelancing projects
* sending basic graphics direct to a SunRay thin client display (Java, with help from reverse-engineered UDP protocol docs)
* watching live production traffic ramp up on a WebSocket-based chat I helped build for an N-million user social site

Some of my more recent write-ups and research work follow.

Ubiquitous UI/UX:

    * [facebook-messenger-streams: Facebook Messenger API Stream Wrapper](https://github.com/myplanet/facebook-messenger-streams)

Database persistence and ORM work:

    * [Somewhat discouraging responses on Reddit :)](https://www.reddit.com/r/programming/comments/2t36ra/disappointed_in_orm_keyvalue_store_might_be_a/)

Workflow and team operations:

* I am really interested in Git as representing both a snapshot state store and a malleable chain of worksets: it seems useful beyond coding, especially when bridging with non-tech workflows
    * [git-inbox: Slack bot to convert uploads into Git commits/PRs](https://github.com/unframework/git-inbox)
    * [S3 Password Agent: password-protect Amazon AWS S3 download links for static sites like Jekyll / GitHub Pages](https://github.com/unframework/s3-password-agent)
