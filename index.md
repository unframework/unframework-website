I read books and write software.

My primary research interest is in modelling real-life communication and business workflows and using that to improve human process and automation. That means both back-end topics like data versioning and consistency and front-end matters like HCI/UX. In addition, I spend time analyzing software development techniques themselves - founded on a belief that [programming is theory-building](http://www.dc.uba.ar/materias/plp/cursos/material/programmingAsTheoryBuilding).

I am available for React/Redux front-end project work; please see [my service sheet](/services/react-development)!

See my [code samples and open source projects on GitHub](https://github.com/unframework), [a few demos on CodePen](http://codepen.io/unframework/), my [Twitter profile](https://twitter.com/unframework) and [Medium posts](https://medium.com/@unframework) plus occasional [presentation upload on my SpeakerDeck page](https://speakerdeck.com/unframework). I also dabble in pictures: [see my Flickr profile](https://www.flickr.com/photos/nickmatantsev/).

I was born into a family of engineers, and my life has always revolved around tech. My mother worked as a lead programmer on her team and brought home books about C, graphics algorithms and computer internals. My father supplied me with a constant stream of math challenges and assembly language instruction manuals. In high-school, I helped my friends set up websites and programmed server software for them. And my early professional start as a summer contract intern at a financial institution helped me learn how to balance technical problem-solving against the *realpolitik* of large teams.

Some of my more recent write-ups and research work follow.

Workflow and team operations:

* I am really interested in Git as representing both a snapshot state store and a malleable chain of worksets: it seems useful beyond coding, especially when bridging with non-tech workflows
