Hi there, I am Nick, and I am ready to help architect, develop and deliver your next React-driven enterprise UI or portal.

Rich single-page application (SPA) front-end development has been my core focus for many years now, and I have a proven track record of delivering production code, confidently guiding technical effort and architecting against project risks. Even though I have worked with many different frameworks - from hand-coded jQuery to Backbone to AngularJS - currently I specialize in React and Redux-based app front-end code.
