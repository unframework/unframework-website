Building modern Web user interfaces is a battleground of complexity and competing requirements. Traditionally underestimated, a slew of "underwater rocks" threaten project deadlines, inflate budgets and result in poorly-performing and alienating user experiences: all despite project teams' best intentions. Ever-changing specifications and large codebases compound these effects exponentially.

Take control of project risk by including an experienced front-end software architect on board as early as possible. A well-thought-out foundation adds stability to feature delivery and maintenance of the project for the months and years of its existence.

For projects that are already underway, consider a midterm architecture spot check: it might just save your team from missing out on cost-saving techniques or producing quality below market expectation.
