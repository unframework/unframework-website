Building modern Web user interfaces is a battleground of complexity and competing requirements. Traditionally underestimated, a slew of "underwater rocks" threaten project deadlines, inflate budgets and result in poorly-performing and alienating user experiences: all despite project teams' best intentions. Ever-changing specifications and large codebases compound these effects exponentially.

Take control of project risk around UI requirements by including an experienced UI architect on board as early as possible. Well-designed foundations add stability to feature delivery and maintenance of the project for the months and years of its existence.
